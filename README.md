## UhDesign Free Premium Responsive Wordpress Theme

### This theme was built with Wordpress version 5.2.2

For my first theme, I decided to use a few un-conventional (per Wordpress standard) practices:
1. Namespaces, throughout my software development experience with PHP, 
I found this practice extremely useful. Not sure why Wordpress still not using it
2. Design patterns, looking through source codes of other themes, they're
not taking advantage of design patterns. This is another useful design paradigm
3. Json, using json to store static data where applicable
4. Separate HTML and PHP as much as possible
5. And most importantly, unit tests

Thank you for using UhDesign.
